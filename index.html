    <p>At <strong>Gardening Place</strong> we strive to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help in cataloging plants</li>
        <li>Provide a list of helper sites</li>
        <li>Provide a calendar of tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Gardening is hard work, however organization can help make it a little easier. By having a schedule
        of what to plant when along with what was planted previously and what worked and what didn't, the
        future gardens should just get better and better
